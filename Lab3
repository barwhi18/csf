# Write a Python program, saved in a file called lab3.py to do the following:

# It contains a variable 'n' (without the quotes), to which you assign some 
# integer.
# It contains a variable 'series' (without the quotes), to which you assign 
# some string of characters (Read Think Python 8.1)

# if the variable 'series' is equal to the string 'fibonacci'  
# (read Think Python 5.2 for comparison operators)
# then compute and print the nth fibonacci number, as defined in lecture on 
# Tuesday.

# otherwise if the variable 'series' is equal to the string 'sum'
# then compute and print the sum of the numbers 3 + 6 + 9 + â€¦ + 3n
# (read Think Python 5.6)

# otherwise print the string "Invalid string"

# [10/18/2013] Added quotes around the variable names: 'n' and 'series'
