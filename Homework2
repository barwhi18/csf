### Reflection
###

# This assignment took an estimated 5 hours. I did several tutorials and read 
# through the class text, but I did not make any progress until I met with a 
# tutor. I was getting hung up on the smallest mistakes and got very frustrated.
# Lecture was much more helpful using my own laptop. I was able to save all my 
# work in class on Canopy as notes.
