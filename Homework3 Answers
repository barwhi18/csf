Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

Problem 3:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

seq: invalid floating point argument: =

barwhi18@ccm-2610-d5:homework3$ python dna_analysis.py data/sample_1.fastq
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 66, in <module>
    gc_count = gc_count + 1
NameError: name 'gc_count' is not defined

these variables become undefined, therefor the program cannot run successfully.

Reflection:

I had a hard time getting started with this homework, but after I received some help from classmates I was able to get through it.
